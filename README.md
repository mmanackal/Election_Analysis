## Overview of Election Audit
Our task was to help Seth and Tom submit an audit of the election results to the election commission. Diana DeGette was determined to be the winner after totaling the voter counts.
The election commission came back and requested voter turnout by county, percentage of votes by county, and the county with the highest turnout. We had to go back and tweak our code to include this information as a part of the audit. Denver county had the highest voter turnout.

## Election-Audit Summary:
It was pleasure to work with Seth and Tom to provide the election analysis. I think it would be helpful to also review the nubmer of votes each candidate received by county to see where they did well and where they didn't perform well. This would help the candidates better prepare for the next election. It would also be useful to see what the total populate is for these counties and determine what % of the population came to vote. Even though Denver has the largest voter turnout, we can't determine if that's 90% of their voting population or 50%. This would also help candidates determine where to campaign more to encourage eligible voters show up to the poll locations.
